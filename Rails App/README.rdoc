The sample app was built using Michael Hartl's rails guide. It contains some static pages along with a users model in order for users to create logins and  login into the site. The login forms are all fully tested using TDD, the passwords are all salted hashes and the site uses HTTPS site wide. The forms also protect against CSRF attacks. The site uses Bootstrap along with SASS in order to format the layout.
